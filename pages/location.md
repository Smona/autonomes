# Choosing a location

The location you choose for your autonome is extremely important. The more resources you have available, the more autonomous your unit will be.

## Lumber

Wood is an essential resource for construction, and can be used to make charcoal and stay cozy in the cold.
Your plot should have enough space to support a renewable grove of trees, and ideally enough unoccupied surrounding area to support future expansion.

## Water

The property should adjoin a reliable source of fresh water. This can be either a river or a sizeable lake.

Rivers can present an advantage over lakes if they provide shipping lanes to the sea. But due to the relatively small scale of autonomes, sea transport of goods isn't expected to benefit much from economies of scale.
