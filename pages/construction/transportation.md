# Transportation

## Roads

Due to their self-contained nature, autonomes aren't expected to be as car-friendly in design as, for example,
the average American suburb. However, roads are necessary for any form of vehicular transport, which is
indispensable for transporting materials or heavy equipment.

### Paving materials and options

Do you need paved roads? Some cities are intentionally [unpaving roads](https://www.wired.com/2016/07/cash-strapped-towns-un-paving-roads-cant-afford-fix/)
which don't see a lot of use to save money.

Some of the benefits of paved roads over dirt/gravel are:

- Less wear and tear on vehicles.
- Prevention of dust plumes, which can be harmful to people & wildlife.
- Prevention of erosion.
- Better navigability in poor weather, no mud.

However, some work in going into designing solutions to these problems that don't require expensive materials
like concrete or asphalt, or complex paving machinery. Additionally, inspiration can be taken from antiquity
in the form of paving solutions like stone.

The [Penn State Center for Dirt and Gravel Road Studies](https://www.dirtandgravel.psu.edu/) studies ways to
construct and maintain environmentally sensitive, unpaved roadways. They publish many documents describing
designs and techniques, which require further investigation.

The article above mentions that "crews can even tamp down dust problems by regularly applying water-absorbing
calcium chloride, organic petroleum, and vegetable oils and animal fats." This is a potential target for
automation.
