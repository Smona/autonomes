# Society

Achieving an equitable, sustainable, autonomous community is not just an engineering problem.
The people living in the community are its greatest resource, and maintaining social harmony
is essential for providing a good life for community participants.

## Legal structure

Autonomes are designed to work both in the current social paradigm of a liberal democracy, as well
as a hypothetical post-collapse world. That consideration is a core part of isolating them from external
uncertainty.

In order to establish autonomes within a capitalist liberal democracy without sacrificing on their core values,
it's important to think carefully about satisfying external state demands and crafting both internal and external
legal structures which prevent the introduction of perverse incentives.
