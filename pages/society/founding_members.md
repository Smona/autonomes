# Founding members

The founding members of an autonome are responsible for establishing the physical, social, and economic
foundation needed for an autonome to be set in motion. A significant initial investment of skills and capital
is necessary to pull together enough resources to reach autonomy, so choosing the founding members carefully.

### Necessary skills

The following core skills need to be represented in the initial group:

- Software Engineer
- Construction
- Electrical engineer
- Electrician
- Plumber
- Paving
- Agriculture
- Mechanic

Then there are skills which are required for full autonomy, but can be recruited after the autonome's founding
if nearby resources support meeting these needs externally.

- Doctor
- Security
