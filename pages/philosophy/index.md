## Core Principles

There are a few core principles which guide the decisions made in this specification.
These are essentially the values from which all system design options are evaluated.

### Self-governance

The people making decisions about the governance of a system should be the ones who have
a stake in it. Additionally, as many stakeholders as possible should have a say in governance of the system.

### Incentive alignment

Human behavior is largely governed by incentives. Whether those incentives are emotional, financial, or something else,
people will tend to act in their own self-interest. This bias towards self-interested decisions is the source
of much of the corruption in our current society.

Since self-interest seems to be part of human nature, a harmonious society must be designed to carefully
avoid perverse incentives, and align the incentives of individuals in a society with each other towards common goals.

### Sustainability

Autonomes should operate by permaculture standards. Economies should be designed as much
as possible around closed loops. Without sustainable practices, autonomes fail to deliver the
long-term stability needed to support a society.
