## Autonomy

The concept of autonomy is central to autonomes, as suggested by the name! Merriam-Webster defines
[autonomy](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/autonomy) as:

1. the state of existing or acting separately from others, or
2. the power or right of a country, group, etc., to govern itself.

In the context of autonomes, the primary focus is on the first definition. States have claimed the majority
of available land, most of them allowing individuals to claim land and resources which they don't personally
use to the exclusion of others. States such as the USA are very powerful, making the prospect of a full-on
revolution distant and faint.

However, by designing a system which provides all its own needs and is able to meet the demands of the state,
a community can be established which doesn't rely on the state, and thus governs its own affairs.

### Levels of autonomy [WIP]

#### Level 0

Level 0 internally provides the most basic resources and services needed for a community to function. It allows
for outsourcing of goods and services which require the most significant initial investment or rare resources, or
are easily provided by the surrounding communities and/or businesses.

## Core Principles

There are a few core principles which guide the decisions made in this specification.
These are essentially the values from which all system design options are evaluated.

### Self-governance

The people making decisions about the governance of a system should be the ones who have
a stake in it. Additionally, as many stakeholders as possible should have a say in governance of the system.

### Incentive alignment

Human behavior is largely governed by incentives. Whether those incentives are emotional, financial, or something else,
people will tend to act in their own self-interest. This bias towards self-interested decisions is the source
of much of the corruption in our current society.

Since self-interest seems to be part of human nature, a harmonious society must be designed to carefully
avoid perverse incentives, and align the incentives of individuals in a society with each other towards common goals.

### Sustainability

Autonomes should operate by permaculture standards. Economies should be designed as much
as possible around closed loops. Without sustainable practices, autonomes fail to deliver the
long-term stability needed to support a society.
